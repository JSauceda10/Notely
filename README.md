# Notely
An ASP.NET core project using REST APIs
(uses the .NET SDK version 3.1.1)
This backend project is meant to be an example of a Rest API implementation. At this point, it is ready to be consumed by a front-end
application made in React or Angular. When the project is downloaded and run, it can be tested using the swagger documentation page 
that can be accessed by adding "/swagger/index.html" after the localhost port.

ex: "locahost:[port number]/swagger/index.html"
